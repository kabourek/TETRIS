game-board (tetrion)
  matrix Size
    rows: 20 // row 21,22 are for spawning in pieces
    columns: 10
  pieces cannot move outside of dimensions of game-board
  display-next-piece - when a piece enters the field, the next piece is displayed
  pieces are spawned randomly // *randomizer https://tetris.wiki/TGM_randomizer
    at row 21,22 (top) above the playable game-board and within columns 4,7 (mid)



game pieces (name, color, size)
  I block (line piece)
    color: blue or cyan
    (4,1) matrix
      [1,
       1,
       1,
       1,]

  J block (left hook)
    color: purple
    (2,3) matrix
      [1,0,0
       1,1,1]

  L block (right hook) / mirror to J block
    color: orange
    (2,3) matrix
      [0,0,1
       1,1,1]

  O block (square)
    color: yellow
    (2,2) matrix
      [1,1
       1,1]

  S block (right turn)
    color: green
    (2,3) matrix
      [0,1,1
       1,1,0]

  Z block (left turn) / mirror to S block
    color: red
    (2,3) matrix
      [1,1,0
       0,1,1]

  T block (triangle)
    color: purple
    (2,3) matrix
      [0,1,0
       1,1,1]

rotating pieces (states of tetronimoes)
    the O block has one state
    the S,Z,I blocks have two states
    the L,J,T blocks have 4 states

    logic for rotation
      key-press (up/down) // clockwise/counter-clockwise

moving pieces
  drop: downwards motion
    gravity (automatic drop)
      0.1G = 1 cell per 10 frames (default)
      1G = 1 cell per frame
  soft drop
    increase gravity by key-press (down-arrow)
      either 20 to 60 blocks per second // (assuming 60fps)
      2G = 2 cells per frame
      6G = 6 cells per frame
  hard drop
    increase gravity by key-press (spacebar)
      20G = 20 cells per frame

  left and right shifting
    Delayed Auto Shift (DAS) (holding the L/R-key)
      delay between holding the directional key and the auto-shifting of gravity
      *auto-repeat rate* - the rate at which input repeats (either milliseconds or frames)
    L/R press (not hold) - no delay in gravity, just a rotation of the piece

piece & board interaction
  locking (coincides with drop) - pieces are in a fixed position
    lock delay - half second delay (30frames) a piece waits on the ground before locking
      can shift or rotate block within this timeframe (*twists/spin-moves)
        reset if not grounded after this timeframe (free space below)
  line clear - row disappears when filled
    above pieces shift downwards (settle) upon cleared line (naive gravity)
      this leaves floating blocks (opposed to sticky gravity - *another mode*)
    points per clear (single-1,double-3,triple-5,tetris-8)
      *combos later* back-to-back tetris - 12points
    *optional delay after clear - 1/2 second


initial state (start-screen)
  display tabs (play, controls, quit)
    play-tab - initializes tetris, key-press to start
      (later add next-piece tab)
    controls-tab - displays all applicable controls
      arrow keys:
        L/R shifting
        Down - soft drop
        Up - 180 rotate
      Spacebar - hard drop
      Z,X - rotate piece clockwise, counter clockwise
      escape - pause (displays over screen)
      **add storing pieces later**
    quit-tab (should prompt to exit program)


play-modes
  timed - 2-3 minute (scored)
  40 lines - timed and scored
lose - top out
  a game piece cannot be placed within the play zone
  *later* - garbage pieces are sent, pushing top pieces to spawn zone
